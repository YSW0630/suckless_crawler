# suckless_crawler

This is my first crawler for those who wants to check their suckless programs are up to date or not

## The reason I make this crawler

I used dwm 6.4 with lots of patches without git, but when 6.5 version released, I need to download it and re-patched all again.

## The reason I'm still using this crawler

First, I check the git repository of suckless [the link](https://git.suckless.org/), I find out there are only few commits between version 6.4 and version 6.5,
that means I can grab those diff files (commits) and manually patch them into my custom suckless prgrams.
